## Applying a theme to the whole app

To support custom themes, paper exports a `Provider` component. You need to wrap your root component with the provider to be able to support themes.

```js
import * as React from 'react';
import { Provider as PaperProvider } from 'react-native-paper';
import App from './src/App';

export default function Main() {
  return (
    <PaperProvider>
      <App />
    </PaperProvider>
  );
}
```

If no prop is specified, this will apply the [default theme](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-paper/blob/master/src/styles/DefaultTheme.js) to the components. You can also provide a `theme` prop with a theme object with same properties as the default theme:

```js
import * as React from 'react';
import { DefaultTheme, Provider as PaperProvider } from 'react-native-paper';
import App from './src/App';

const theme = {
  ...DefaultTheme,
  roundness: 2,
  colors: {
    ...DefaultTheme.colors,
    primary: '#3498db',
    accent: '#f1c40f',
  }
};

export default function Main() {
  return (
    <PaperProvider theme={theme}>
      <App />
    </PaperProvider>
  );
}
```

You can change the theme prop dynamically and all the components will automatically update to reflect the new theme.

A theme usually contains the following properties:

- `dark` (`boolean`): whether this is a dark theme or light theme.
- `roundness` (`number`): roundness of common elements, such as buttons.
- `colors` (`object`): various colors used throught different elements.
  - `primary` - primary color for your app, usually your brand color.
  - `accent` - secondary color for your app which complements the primary color.
  - `background` - background color for pages, such as lists.
  - `paper` - background color for elements containing content, such as cards.
  - `text` - text color for content.
  - `disabled` - color for disabled elements.
  - `placeholder` - color for placeholder text, such as input placeholder.
- `fonts` (`object`): various fonts used throught different elements.
  - `regular`
  - `medium`
  - `light`
  - `thin`

When creating a custom theme, you will need to provide all of these properties.

## Applying a theme to a paper component

If you want to change the theme for a certain component from the library, you can directly pass the `theme` prop to the component. The theme passed as the prop is merged with the theme from the `Provider`.

```js
import * as React from 'react';
import { Button } from 'react-native-paper';

export default function ButtonExample() {
  return (
    <Button raised theme={{ roundness: 3 }}>
      Press me
    </Button>
  );
}
```

## Using the theme in your own components

To access the theme in your own components, you can use the `withTheme` HOC exported from the library. If you wrap your component with the HOC, you'll receive the theme as a prop.

```js
import * as React from 'react';
import { withTheme } from 'react-native-paper';

function MyComponent(props) {
  const { colors } = props.theme;
  return <Text style={{ color: colors.primary }}>Yo!</Text>;
}

export default withTheme(MyComponent);
```

Components wrapped with `withTheme` support the theme from the `Provider` as well as from the `theme` prop.

## Customizing all instances of a component

Sometimes you want to style a component in a different way everywhere and don't want to change the properties in the theme so that other components are not affected. For example, say you want to change the font of all your buttons, but don't want to change `theme.fonts.medium` because it affects other components.

We don't have an API to do this, because you can already do it with components:

```js
import * as React from 'react';
import { Button } from 'react-native-paper';

export default function RoundButton(props) {
  return <Button theme={{ fonts: { medium: 'Open Sans' } }} {...props} />;
}
```

Now you can use `RoundButton` everywhere instead of using `Button`.

## Gotchas

The `Provider` exposes the theme to the components via [React's context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html), which means that the component must be in the same tree as the `Provider`. Some React Native components will render a different tree such as a `Modal`, in which case the components inside the `Modal` won't be able to access the theme. The work around is to get the theme using the `withTheme` HOC and pass it down to the components as props, or expose it again with the exported `ThemeProvider` component.

The `Modal` component from the library already handles this edge case, so you won't need to do anything.
